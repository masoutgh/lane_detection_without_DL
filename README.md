Real-time Lane Detection Using Basic Computer Vision Techniques

this repository contains a Python implementation of real-time lane detection using basic computer vision techniques. The code uses OpenCV library for image processing.


## Algorithm Overview
The lane detection algorithm used in this code follows these basic steps:

- Load the input video stream,
- Resize frames,
- Change perspective,
- Convert color space to Lab and HLS,
- Use a sliding window to detect the lanes.
